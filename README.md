Whats Working:
Wifi
Bluetooth
Trackpad
Mouse
All USB Ports
Battery Detector
Microphone
Camera
Waking From SLeep
Screen Savers

Whats Not Working:
HDMI Since The Port Is Wired To NVIDIA.
NVIDIA Graphics Card As MacOS Never Nativity Supported It.
Backlight But Who Ever Uses It Am I Right?!

If Your Not Going To Use Icloud For Your Computer Which I Highly Suggest You Dont Use Icloud, because that results into you just putting the efi on the usb and adding the installer instead of spending 5 hours chainging the serial number.

My Specs

CPU :Intel I7 10th Gen, Also The Intel I5 10th Gen Works, And You Wont Even Need To Change A Thing
Graphics Card: NVIDIA GTX 1650 TI With Max Q Design (Disabled On MacOS)
RAM: 16GB
Storage: 1.5TB
WIFI And Bluetooth: Intel Wirless Card
Laptop Keyboard And Touchpad: VoodoPS2

Credits To My Guy On Reddit Named Forte500 For Providing Me With The EFI That Works For Ventura And Monetery And BigSur.
Credits To Me On Updating The EFI To Opencore 1.0 And Making It Support Sonoma, I Have Eliminated As Much Bugs As Possible.
Thank You And Enjoy Your Hackintosh EFI, I Hope Everything Goes Well!
